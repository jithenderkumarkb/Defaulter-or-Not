Credit risk analysis

In this case study I have used algortihms which makes the best fit for the prediction of target value and checked its perfomance across algorithms used and submitted which gives the best in Analytics Vidhya website.To the best of my knowledge, I have implemented the algorithms which I am familiar with and in the process of exploring new algorithms. I would update the code with that new algorithm implementation.

Problem Statement

This case study deals with whether to provide loan to a individual based on several features considered in the banking sector and other features with respect to this data.Nowadays there are many features to be considered for this case study but this is just a sample to make predictions off.Again it is a classifier problem so we must use algortithsm which are good for predicted target vakue in terms of discrete and evaluate based on confusion matrix and accuracy scores.
